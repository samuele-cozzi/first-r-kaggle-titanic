This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

Let's start

Import library

```{r}
library(ggplot2) # Data visualization
library(readr) # CSV file I/O, e.g. the read_csv function

library(rpart) #decision tree
library(rattle)
library(rpart.plot)
library(RColorBrewer)
```

Import data

```{r}
#Import the training set: train
train_url <- "http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/course/Kaggle/train.csv"
train <- read.csv(train_url)

#Import the testing set: test
test_url <- "http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/course/Kaggle/test.csv"
test <- read.csv(test_url)

#visualize data sets
str(train)
str(test)
```

Analayze data

Male vs Female
```{r}
# Survival rates in absolute numbers
table(train$Survived)

# Survival rates in proportions
prop.table(table(train$Survived))
  
# Two-way comparison: Sex and Survived
table(train$Sex, train$Survived)

# Two-way comparison: row-wise proportions
prop.table(table(train$Sex, train$Survived),1)
```

```{r}
# Create the column child, and indicate whether child or no child
train$Child <- NA
train$Child[train$Age < 18] <- 1
train$Child[train$Age >= 18] <- 0

# Two-way comparison
prop.table(table(train$Child, train$Survived),1)
```

First prediction

```{r}
# Copy of test
test_one <- test

# Initialize a Survived column to 0
test_one$Survived <- 0

# Set Survived to 1 if Sex equals "female"
test_one$Survived[test_one$Sex == 'female'] <- 1


```
